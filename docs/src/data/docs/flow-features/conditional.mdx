title: "Conditional Flow"
---

- You can create conditional flows, to do this, just use the `if` method, passing boolean or a function that returns a boolean, then all robots that were added below will only be executed if the condition is true.
- You can add an `else`, to then execute if the condition is false, and to return to the normal flow, just use `endif`.

```ts
Factory
  .createFlow(state)
    .if((factory) => factory.state.get("images").length > 0)
      .pipe(DownloadImagesRobot)
    .else()
      .pipe(FetchImagesRobot)
      .pipe(DownloadImagesRobot)
    .endif()
  .execute()

```
