title: "Do-while Loop Flow"
---

- You can create a loop flow, to do this, just use the `do` method, then all robots that were added below.
- To return to the normal flow, just use `while`, passing boolean or a function that returns a boolean.
- The loop it will only be executed as long as the condition remains `true`.

```ts

Factory
  .createFlow(state)
    .do()
      .pipe(FetchSingleImageRobot)
      .pipe(DownloadSingleImageRobot)
    .while((factory) => factory.state.get("remainingImages").length > 0)
  .execute()

```
