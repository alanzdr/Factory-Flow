---
You can stop the flow at any time, to do this, just call the `stop` method, the flow will be stopped.

```ts

Factory
  .createFlow(state)
    .if((factory) => factory.state.get("images").length > 0)
      .pipe(DownloadImagesRobot)
    .else()
      .pipe(FetchImagesRobot)
      // Stop the flow here
      .stop()
    .endif()
    // This robot will not be executed in the else condition 
    .pipe(ARemainingRobot)
  .execute()

```
