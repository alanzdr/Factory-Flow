Factory Flow is a library designed to streamline the creation of automated robotic workflows.

It employs a series of principles inspired by factory production lines, where each station, or `robot`, executes a specific task independently of the preceding or succeeding robots. By focusing on the current state and transforming it to pass along the line, Factory Flow ensures an efficient and organized processing sequence.

## Principles

Factory Flow operates on three key principles that guide its functionality and design:

### Isolation

Each robot in the workflow is isolated from the others. This means that a robot performs its specific function without needing details about the tasks performed by the robots before or after it. This principle ensures modularity, allowing tasks to be developed and tested independently, reducing complexity and potential errors in the workflow.

### Transformation

Robots operate by taking in the current state, performing their designated task, and transforming it into a new state for the next robot. This method of state transformation ensures that each step in the process builds off the results of the previous one, facilitating seamless data handling throughout the flow.

### Preservation

The State is automatically saved after each robot completes its task. This means that if there's an error or interruption in the process, the flow can resume from the point it halted, rather than starting over. Automatic state persistence improves reliability and efficiency, ensuring minimal data loss and reduced downtime.

## Features

Factory Flow provides several features to enhance workflow automation, encouraging robust and reliable process management:

- **Configurable Flows**: you can customize the flow by easily adding, removing, or reordering robots to meet specific task requirements.
- **Logging**: Factory Flow provides detailed logs system, allowing you to monitor the workflow's progress and identify potential issues.
- **Error Handling**: integrated error-handling guarantees workflows are resilient, with tools for debugging and troubleshooting without disrupting the entire sequence.
- **Scalability**: designed to handle a variety of tasks, Factory Flow can scale from simple workflows to complex automation sequences, accommodating increased demand.
- **Extra modules**: Factory Flow provides additional modules to extend its functionality, such as the `Parallel` module, which allows you to run tasks in parallel.


## Use Cases

Factory Flow's versatility makes it an ideal solution for various applications, such as:

- **Data Processing Pipelines**: Automate and streamline data collection, transformation, and export processes in data engineering workflows.
- **Web Scraping**: Automate web scraping tasks to extract data from websites and APIs for analysis, reporting, or integration with other systems.
- **Content Management**: Automate repetitive content management tasks, like formatting and metadata updates, across digital platforms.
- **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)**: Create RPA workflows to automate repetitive tasks, such as data entry, form filling, and report generation.
- **Testing Automation**: Develop automated testing workflows to validate software functionality, performance, and security.
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Coordinate complex workflows across multiple systems and services, ensuring seamless data flow and task execution.
- **Image Handling**: Efficiently manage workflows involving images, such as batch processing for downloads, resizing, and optimization.

Factory Flow's flexibility and adaptability make it a valuable tool for developers, data scientists, and automation engineers looking to optimize their workflows and increase productivity.
