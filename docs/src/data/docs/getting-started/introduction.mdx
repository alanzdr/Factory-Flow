import Image from 'next/image'

Imagine a scenario where you need to run a script that goes through a image database, downloads them in a folder, checks their size and optimizes very heavy images.

Doing this script from the beginning can bring some challenges, such as the time it takes to execute each step of the process, or if an error occurs in the middle, you may need to run it from the beginning again.

<div className="center-image">
  <Image 
    src="/assets/docs/console-1.png" 
    width={662}
    height={494}
    quality={90}
    alt="Factory Flow Logs"
  />
</div>
