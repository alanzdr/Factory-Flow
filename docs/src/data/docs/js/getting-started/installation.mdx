## Manual installation

After starting a new node.js project, install the dependency using your preferred manager.

```bash
# Yarn
yarn add factory-flow

# NPM
npm install factory-flow

# PNPM
pnpm install factory-flow
```

Currently the package only works in "ES modules", so you need to set the `type` field in your `package.json` to `module`.

```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

The use of typescript is not mandatory but is highly recommended.
