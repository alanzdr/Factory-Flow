## Manual installation

To get started with Factory Flow in your Node.js project, first ensure you've initiated your project. Then, install the Factory Flow dependency using your preferred package manager. Choose from the options below:

```bash
# For Yarn users
yarn add factory-flow

# For NPM users
npm install factory-flow

# For PNPM users
pnpm install factory-flow
```

### Configuration

Factory Flow is designed to work with ES modules. To enable this, update your package.json by setting the type field to module:

```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

### TypeScript

Although using TypeScript is not mandatory, it is highly recommended to fully leverage the capabilities and type-safety features of Factory Flow. Ensure your development environment is set up for TypeScript to maximize your experience with the library.
