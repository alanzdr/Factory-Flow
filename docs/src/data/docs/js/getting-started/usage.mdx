## Getting Started

Begin by following the [Installation Guide](/docs/js/getting-started/installation) to set up Factory Flow in your project.


## Building Your Robots


Organize your robots by creating a dedicated folder and assigning each robot its own file. Each robot should extend the `Robot` class and implement the `execute` method to define its task.

### Example:

- **Robot to Fetch Image URLs**:

```ts
// robots/fetchImages.ts
import { Robot } from "factory-flow/core";

class FetchImagesRobot extends Robot {
  async execute(): Promise<void> {
    const images: string[] = [];
    // Add your code to fetch the images here
    this.state.set("images", images);
    // ou can also append to existing state data
    this.state.set("images", (oldImages) => {
      return [...oldImages, ...images];
    });
  }
}

export default FetchImagesRobot;
```
- **Robot to Download Images**:

```ts
// robots/downloadImages.ts
import { Robot } from "factory-flow/core";

class DownloadImagesRobot extends Robot {
  async execute(): Promise<void> {
    const images: string[] = this.state.get("images");
    const alreadyDownloaded: string[] = 
      this.state.get("downloaded") || [];

    for (const image of images) {
      if (alreadyDownloaded.includes(image)) {
        continue;
      }
       // Code to download the image goes here
      alreadyDownloaded.push(image);
      // Keep the state updated to avoid re-downloading
      this.state.set("downloaded", alreadyDownloaded);
      await this.state.save();
    }
  }
}

export default DownloadImagesRobot;
```

## Setting Up the State Manager

Define a state manager for the factory. You can either extend the `FactoryState` class for a custom implementation or use a pre-built option from the library.

### Example:

- **Using a JSON file**: Leverage a JSON file to manage state.

```ts
// state.ts
import { JSONState } from "factory-flow/core";

interface State {
  images: string[];
  downloaded: string[];
}

const initialState: State = {
  images: [],
  downloaded: [],
};

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const statePath = path.resolve(path.dirname(__filename), "state.json");

const state = new JSONState<State>(initialState, statePath);

export default state;
```

- **Creating a custom state**: Alternatively, create a tailored state management system.

```ts
// state.ts
import { FactoryState } from "factory-flow/core";

interface State {
  images: string[];
  downloaded: string[];
}

class CustomState extends FactoryState<State> {
  constructor(initialState: State) {
    super(initialState);
  }

  public async initialize() {
     // Initialize state from saved data
    return true;
  }

  public async save() {
    // Save state updates as needed
  }
}

const initialState: State = {
  images: [],
  downloaded: [],
};

const state = new CustomState(initialState);

export default state;
```

## Creating and Executing the Factory Flow

Construct the factory flow by adding robots and executing them in sequence.

```ts
// factory.ts
import { Factory } from "factory-flow/core";

import FetchImagesRobot from "./robots/fetchImages";
import DownloadImagesRobot from "./robots/downloadImages";
import state from "./state";

// Build and execute the factory flow
Factory.createFlow(state)
  .pipe(FetchImagesRobot)
  .pipe(DownloadImagesRobot)
  .execute();

// Alternatively, encapsulate in an async function
async function runImageDownloadFactory() {
  const factory = await Factory
    .createFlow(state)
    .pipe(FetchImagesRobot)
    .pipe(DownloadImagesRobot)
    .execute();
  // Access the state post-execution
  console.log(factory.state.get("downloaded"));
}

```

After adding the robots, the `.execute()` method must be called for the factory to begin the process.
