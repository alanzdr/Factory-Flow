### Make your robots know the State

<i>Only in `typescript`</i>

Pass the State Class as the first Generic when extending the Robot, now when you call `this.state` inside the robot, it will be typed with the state you passed.

```ts
// robots/fetchImages.ts
import CustomState from '../state';
import { Robot } from "factory-flow/core";

class FetchImagesRobot extends Robot<CustomState> {
  async execute(): Promise<void> {
    // return the type that was declared in the state, 
    // in this case, string[]
    const images = this.state.get("images");
    // ... your code to get the images here
    this.state.set("images", images);
  }
}

export default FetchImagesRobot;
```
