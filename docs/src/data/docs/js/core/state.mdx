description: "Where the entire process is saved"

The `State` is where the current process data is saved, It is important to keep the execution of each robot saved, to prevent costly operations from being executed multiple times.

## Custom State Implementation

To define a custom state, extend the `FactoryState` class and implement the `initialize` and `save` methods, which manage data loading and persistence.


```ts
import { FactoryState } from "factory-flow/core";
import type { MyState } from "./types";

// Example of some database implementation
import Database from './database'

class CustomState extends FactoryState<MyState> {
  constructor(initialState: MyState) {
    super(initialState);
  }

  public async initialize(): Promise<void> {
    // Initialize state from saved data
    this.data = await Database.load()
    return true;
  }

  public async save(): Promise<void> {
    // Save state updates as needed
    await Database.save(this.data)
  }
}
```

- **initialize**: Executes at the commencement of the Factory execution, tasked with loading the initial state.
- **save**: Invoked after each robot execution or manually during the robot's operation, ensuring state updates are captured.

## Pre-built State Implementations

The Factory Flow library offers some predefined state implementations for ease of use:

### JSON State

A convenient option for persisting state data within a JSON file located in the project directory, suitable for many applications requiring simple persistence.

```ts
// state.ts
import { JSONState } from "factory-flow/core";

interface State {
  images: string[];
  downloaded: string[];
}

const initialState: State = {
  images: [],
  downloaded: [],
};

const state = new JSONState<State>(initialState, 'state.json');

export default state;
```

The status will automatically be saved in the tmp folder in the project root, but you can edit the folder path in the `JSONState` constructor to save the state file in a different location, just add the folder location as the third parameter.

### Memory State

This state keeps data in memory, utilizing a global variable. It's particularly useful for testing and debugging purposes where persistent storage is unnecessary.

```ts
import { MemoryState } from "factory-flow/core";
import type { MyState } from "./types";

const initialState: MyState = {
  images: [],
  downloaded: [],
};

const state = new MemoryState<MyState>(initialState);

export default state;
```
