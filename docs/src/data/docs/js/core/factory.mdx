The `Factory` class is the cornerstone of Factory Flow, providing the framework to create and manage robot workflows effectively.

## Getting Started

To utilize the `Factory` class, you'll first need to have at least one [Robot](/docs/js/core/robot) and a [State Manager](/docs/js/core/state) configured. Once these are ready, import the Factory from "factory-flow/core" to initiate the flow creation process.

```ts
// factory.ts
import { Factory } from "factory-flow/core";
```

### Executing a Factory Flow

To initiate a Factory Flow, use the `Factory.createFlow()` method, supplying it with your initial state. You can sequentially incorporate robots into the flow using the `pipe` or others [Flow](/docs/js/core/flow) methods.

```ts
Factory.createFlow(state)
  .pipe(FetchImagesRobot)
  .pipe(DownloadImagesRobot)
  .execute();
```

The `execute` method returns a `Promise` that resolves when the flow completes. You can use this to chain additional actions or handle the flow's completion.


```ts
// Alternatively, encapsulate in an async function
async function runImageDownloadFactory() {
  const factory = await Factory
    .createFlow(state)
    .pipe(FetchImagesRobot)
    .pipe(DownloadImagesRobot)
    .execute();
}
```

Post-execution, you can access the `Factory` instance to interact with the state or to start new flows.

```ts
console.log(factory.state.get("downloaded"));
```

To create an additional [Flow](/docs/js/core/flow), use:

```ts
factory.createFlow()
  .pine(AnotherRobot)
  .execute();
```

You can also create a `Factory` object without an initial flow, using the `new` keyword:

```ts
const factory = new Factory(state);
// The create a new flow
await factory.createFlow()
  .pine(AnotherRobot)
  .execute();
```

## Configuration

When creating a new `Factory` or using the createFlow method, you can pass a configuration object to tailor the flow's behavior. The configuration supports:

<div className="attributes">
- `name`: A string for identifying the factory instance, useful in logs and debugging. (default: 'Factory').
- `logLevel`: The verbosity level of logging. acceptable values are `deep`, `shallow` or `none`. (default: 'deep').
</div>

```ts
// with createFlow
Factory.createFlow(state, {
  name: 'My Custom Factory',
  logLevel: 'shallow'
})
// with 'new' keyword
const factory = new Factory(state, {
  name: 'My Custom Factory',
  logLevel: 'shallow'
})
```

## Events

The `Factory` class emits some events during its operation, providing hooks for custom logic and error handling.

- `start`: Emitted when the factory flow begins.
- `error`: Emitted when an error occurs during the execution.
- `finish`: Triggered when the flow completes.

### Emitting Custom Events

It is also possible to emit custom events, using the `Factory.emit()` method.

```ts
factory.emit('myCustomEvent', { status: 'completed' });
```

### Subscribing to Events

Use the `on` method to subscribe to events, or `once` to listen for a single occurrence.

```ts
// Subscribing to the 'error' event
factory.on('error', (error) => {
  console.error('An error occurred:', error);
});
// Listening to a custom event
factory.on('myCustomEvent', (data) => {
  console.log('Custom event received');
});
```

### Accessing Factory Events Inside Robots

Within a `Robot`, access the factory instance through the `this.factory` property to listen and dispatch events.

```ts
import { Robot } from "factory-flow/core";

class MyRobot extends Robot {
  async execute(): Promise<void> {
    // Emit a custom event
    this.factory.emit('myCustomEvent', { status: 'completed' });
    // Subscribing to a custom event
    this.factory.on('myCustomEvent', (data) => {
      console.log('Custom event received');
    });
  }
}

export default MyRobot;
```

### Handling Events in the Flow

Events can be incorporated at the flow level using `on` or `once` method.

```ts
Factory.createFlow(state)
  .pipe(MyRobot)
  .once('myCustomEvent', (data) => {
    console.log('Custom event received');
  })
  .on('error', (error) => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  })
  .execute();
```
