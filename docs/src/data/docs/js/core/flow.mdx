The `Flow` class is the engine responsible for orchestrating the robots in Factory Flow, allowing for the addition of robots, conditions, loops, and error handling.

## Getting Started

To initiate a Factory Flow, employ the `createFlow` method from the Factory, providing the initial state. Use flow methods to incorporate robots into the flow and finalize by invoking the `execute()` method

```ts
Factory.createFlow(state)
  .pipe(MyFirstRobot)
  .pipe(MySecondRobot)
  .execute();
```

Every method in the Flow returns the `Flow` instance, permitting chaining of methods until the execution stage is reached.

Methods such as `if`, `do` or `try` introduce additional layers in the flow. Returning to the main flow layer requires closing these methods with `endif`, `while` or `catch`.

### Comprehensive Flow Example

```ts
Factory
  .createFlow(state)
    // Fetch images URLs
    .do()
      .pipe(FetchImageURLSRobot, {
        url: "https://example.com/images"
      })
    .while((factory) => factory.state.get("remainingImages"))
    // Download images
    .if((factory) => factory.state.get("images").length > 0)
      .pipe(DownloadImagesRobot)
    .else()
      // Terminate the flow if no images are available
      .stop()
    .endif()
    // Update images sizes
    .pipe(UpdateImagesSizesRobot)
    // Attempt to resize images and handle potential errors
    .try()
      .pipe(ResizeImagesRobot)
    .catch(async (error) => {
      console.error("Error resizing images", error);
    })
  .execute()

```

## Flow Methods

### Pipe

The `pipe` method is fundamental for adding a robot to the flow. Pass the robot class as an argument to integrate it into the sequence.

```ts
Factory.createFlow(state)
  .pipe(MyFirstRobot)
  .pipe(MySecondRobot)
  .execute();
```

A configuration object can also be passed as a second argument, which will be used by the robot's constructor.

```ts
Factory.createFlow(state)
  .pipe(MyFirstRobot, { limit: 10 })
  .pipe(MySecondRobot)
  .execute();
```

### If

Conditional flows are facilitated by the `if` method. It takes a boolean or a function returning a boolean, executing subsequent robots only if true. The `else` method is available for false conditions, and returning to the main flow is achieved with `endif`.

```ts
Factory
  .createFlow(state)
    .if((factory) => factory.state.get("images").length > 0)
      .pipe(DownloadImagesRobot)
    .else()
      .pipe(FetchImagesRobot)
      .pipe(DownloadImagesRobot)
    .endif()
  .execute()

```

### Do-While

You can create a loop flow, to do this, just use the `do` method, then all robots that were added below. To return to the normal flow, just use `while`, passing boolean or a function that returns a boolean. 


```ts

Factory
  .createFlow(state)
    .do()
      .pipe(FetchSingleImageRobot)
      .pipe(DownloadSingleImageRobot)
    .while((factory) => factory.state.get("remainingImages"))
  .execute()

```

### Try-Catch

Error handling within flows is managed by the `try-catch` construct. Using `try`, errors encountered in the subsequent robots can be addressed in the `catch` block.

```ts

Factory
  .createFlow(state)
    .try()
      .pipe(FetchImagesRobot)
      .pipe(DownloadImagesRobot)
    .catch(async (error) => {
      console.error("Error fetching images", error);
      // Optionally halt the flow by rethrowing the error
      // throw error;
    })
  .execute()

```

### Stop

Flow execution can be terminated at any point using the `stop` method, ceasing further processing.

```ts

Factory
  .createFlow(state)
    .if((factory) => factory.state.get("images").length > 0)
      .pipe(DownloadImagesRobot)
    .else()
      .pipe(FetchImagesRobot)
      // Terminate the flow at this point
      .stop()
    .endif()
    // This robot will not execute if the flow was stopped
    .pipe(ARemainingRobot)
  .execute()

```
