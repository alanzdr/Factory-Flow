The `Robot` class is the fundamental unit in Factory Flow, representing individual tasks within a workflow. Each robot is designed to perform a specific function, interacting with the state to share and manage data across different robots.

## Getting Started

To define a robot, extend the `Robot` class and implement its `execute` method. This method should encapsulate the core logic for the robot's task, allowing it to interact with the state for reading or updating data.

```ts
import { Robot } from "factory-flow/core";

class MyRobot extends Robot {
  async execute(): Promise<void> {
    // Implement the logic for the robot's task here
  }
}
```

### Custom Parameters

Robots can receive a configuration object, which can be passed as the second parameter in the `pipe` method. This configuration is accessible via the robotâ€™s constructor as the second parameter.

```ts
// In the Robot
import CustomState from '../state';

interface MyRobotSettings {
  limit: number;
}

class FetchImagesRobot extends Robot<CustomState, MyRobotSettings> {
  private limit: number;

  constructor(factory: Factory, settings: MyRobotSettings) {
    super(factory);
    this.limit = settings.limit;
  }

  async execute(): Promise<void> {
    // Execution logic using this.limit
  }
}

// In the Factory

Factory.createFlow(state)
  .pipe(FetchImagesRobot, { limit: 10 })
  .execute();

```

## Using the Robot

Robots access methods and properties to manage state and generate logs, acting as isolated task units that can be combined to form complex workflows.

### State Interaction

Robots are capable of reading from and updating the state during execution. The state is automatically saved after each robot completes its task to ensure data integrity and workflow continuity.

```ts
class MyRobot extends Robot {
  async execute(): Promise<void> {
    // Accessing and modifying state data
    const data = this.state.get("key");
    this.state.set("key", "value");
    await this.state.save(); // Manual save if necessary
  }
}
```

The `Robot` class's first `Generic` parameter specifies the state type, ensuring type-safe state interactions.

```ts
class MyRobot extends Robot<MyState> {
  async execute(): Promise<void> {
    const data = this.state.get("key"); // Typed state access
  }
}
```

### Factory Interaction

Robots can interact with the `Factory` instance for events and others purposes. The `Factory` instance is automatically provided when the robot is instantiated.

```ts
class MyRobot extends Robot {
  async execute(): Promise<void> {
    // Subscribing to events
    this.factory.on('finish', () => {
      console.log('Flow finished');
    });
    // Initiating a new flow with same factory
    // - just be careful to not create a infinite loop
    await this.factory.createFlow()
      .pipe(AnotherRobot)
      .execute();
  }
}
```

Learn more about the `Factory` class [here](/docs/js/core/factory).

### Robot Log Name

To change the name that appears in the robot's logs, simply call the robot's `this.setName()` method sending a string with the new name. (The default name is the robot's class name.)

```ts
class MyRobot extends Robot {
  constructor(factory: Factory) {
    super(factory);
    this.setName('My Great Robot');
  }

  async execute(): Promise<void> {
    this.log.info('Hello World');
  }
}
```



## Logging


You can make logs inside the robots, to do this, just call some method of the `log` module injected inside the robot.

```ts
class LogRobot extends Robot {
  async execute(): Promise<void> {
    this.log.error("Error Message");
    this.log.warning("Warning Message");
    this.log.info("Info Message");
    this.log.success("Success Message");
  }
}
```
