You can pass settings to the robots, to do this, just pass the settings as the second parameter in the `pipe` method as a object, the robot then receives, in constructor second parameter.


```ts
// In the Robot
import CustomState from '../state';

interface Settings {
  limit: number;
}

class FetchImagesRobot extends Robot<CustomState, Settings> {
  private limit: number;

  // The settings are passed as the second parameter
  constructor(factory: Factory, settings: Settings) {
    super(factory);
    this.limit = settings.limit;
  }

  async execute(): Promise<void> {
    // ... robot execution code here
  }
}

// In the Factory

Factory.createFlow(state)
  // Pass the settings as the second parameter
  .pipe(FetchImagesRobot, { limit: 10 })
  .execute();

```
